Your bass has a two way adjustable truss rod. If the neck is too straight for your taste (convex) turn the hexagon screw at the truss rod with the
provided allen key counter clockwise. If you want to have it straighter turn the screw clockwise. In the neutral centre position, the truss rod always feels a little slack. Before playing always tighten the truss rod a little bit by turning the screw slightly in either direction. The rearmost screw on the right adjusts the bridge saddle roll (fig. 3). Once you loosened this screw with the provided allen key you can move the saddle roll sideways into the prefered position. Afterwards, tighten the screw again. First loosen the bridge saddle fixation screw (fig. 4) to enable the bridge saddle move ment. To adjust the action, turn the three vertical screws (two in the front,
one in the back, fig. 2) clockwise to increase and counter clockwise to decrease the distance of the strings to the fretboard.
The intonation is set correctly, if the tone at the 12 th fret is the same
as the 12 th fret harmonic. Is the tone lower than the harmonic, you have to move the saddle towards the neck. First release string tension, then loosen the bridge saddle fixation screw (down right; fig. 4), which adjusts the saddle. You can now move the saddle forwards and backwards. Once the intonation is set up correctly, tighten the screw again.
